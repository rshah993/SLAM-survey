# Extended Kalman Filter SLAM
A simple SLAM simulator that displays the results in a GUI where you can map obstacles and rooms.

# How-to
1. Run setup.m in MATLAB.
2. Either select one of the saved maps saved as .mat files or create a new one.
3. Execute and the resulting image is saved as a .tiff image or a .mat file (as a grid map along with resolution).
